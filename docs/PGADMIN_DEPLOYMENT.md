# pgAdmin deployment and operations

The beta stack publishes pgAdmin only through a dedicated Nginx reverse proxy at
`https://pg.<domain>:14433`. The pgAdmin container has no host port. Nginx and
pgAdmin share a dedicated internal Docker network; pgAdmin listens only on that
network address. A second, separate internal network connects only pgAdmin and
PostgreSQL. The dedicated proxy shares no network with the application, so
pgAdmin cannot reach the application, Redis, observability, or host-facing
services.

Access has two independent login steps:

1. Nginx HTTP Basic Authentication, using a bcrypt `htpasswd` secret.
2. pgAdmin's built-in `internal` email/password authentication.

PostgreSQL remains private: Compose does not publish a PostgreSQL host port.

## Prepare credentials

Create the Git-ignored secret directory in the checkout as the same unprivileged
user that runs deployments. The deployment script rejects symlinks and unsafe
permissions for these files. Do not run deployment with `sudo` when using this
layout.

```bash
cd /srv/yamata
install -d -m 0700 .secrets
install -m 0600 /dev/null .secrets/pgadmin.env
${EDITOR:-vi} .secrets/pgadmin.env
```

The environment file must contain the pgAdmin administrator email only:

```env
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=database-admin@example.com
```

Create a long random initial pgAdmin password in its own file. Compose
file-backed secrets retain the host file's ownership and mode. The pgAdmin
image runs as UID `5050` with primary GID `0`, so the deployment user must own
this file, its group must be `root`, and its mode must be `0640`. Store the
value in the organisation's password manager before deployment.

```bash
(umask 077; openssl rand -base64 48 > .secrets/pgadmin-default-password)
sudo chgrp root .secrets/pgadmin-default-password
chmod 0640 .secrets/pgadmin-default-password
```

Create a separate Nginx Basic Auth identity. `htpasswd` prompts for the
password and stores a bcrypt hash, never the clear-text value. Nginx workers
run as UID/GID 65534, so the deployment user must own the hash file and it
must be group-readable by numeric group `65534`, but inaccessible to other
users. Confirm that host group `65534` has no untrusted local members.

```bash
htpasswd -B -C 12 -c .secrets/pgadmin-nginx.htpasswd pgadmin-edge-admin
sudo chgrp 65534 .secrets/pgadmin-nginx.htpasswd
chmod 0640 .secrets/pgadmin-nginx.htpasswd
```

Set these path references in `.env.beta` (the template already provides these
values). They are file paths only, not credentials:

```env
PGADMIN_ENV_FILE=./.secrets/pgadmin.env
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=./.secrets/pgadmin-default-password
PGADMIN_NGINX_HTPASSWD_FILE=./.secrets/pgadmin-nginx.htpasswd
# The IPv4 address of the host interface intended for administrator access.
PGADMIN_LISTEN_BIND_IP=10.8.0.1
```

Do not use `0.0.0.0` or a loopback address for `PGADMIN_LISTEN_BIND_IP`; the
deployment rejects both. A public interface is supported when the host's PAM,
firewall, and organization access controls protect it. Keep TCP/14433 limited
to the intended administrator population.

The primary certificate at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem` must
include `pg.<domain>` as a SAN or through a wildcard name. The deployment
script verifies this before it starts Nginx.

## Deploy and verify

Run the normal production deployment; it starts and health-checks pgAdmin
before recreating Nginx.

```bash
./scripts/deploy-production-beta.sh --domain example.com
```

Verify the two authentication layers without putting credentials on the
command line:

```bash
curl -I https://pg.example.com:14433
# Expected: HTTP/2 401 with WWW-Authenticate: Basic

curl --user pgadmin-edge-admin https://pg.example.com:14433
# Expected: pgAdmin's own login page
```

Use pgAdmin to register the internal database with host `pgadmin-postgres` and
port `5432`. Use a named PostgreSQL administrator role scoped to the required
maintenance work, not the `postgres` superuser or the application's service
account. Database-password saving is disabled, so enter that credential when
connecting from a password manager. Do not publish a PostgreSQL port or create
a host-level port-forward as a shortcut.

The initial pgAdmin email/password is applied only when the pgAdmin data volume
is first initialized. Rotating that password later must be done through the
pgAdmin UI; rotating the Nginx credential requires regenerating the htpasswd
file and rerunning the normal deployment so Nginx is recreated.

## Security controls

- `dpage/pgadmin4:9.17@sha256:2f4ce946ddf8360680d7eff4eaba1d91859eb6b4003e6623bad5c63a322c2f4d`
  pins the official pgAdmin 9.17 multi-architecture OCI index; review and
  advance the reference for new upstream security releases.
- pgAdmin's root filesystem is read-only, Linux capabilities are dropped, and
  no-new-privileges is enabled. Its persistent data is the dedicated Docker
  volume only; its required runtime and application-log directories are
  non-persistent tmpfs mounts.
- The dedicated Nginx proxy uses non-persistent request-body and upstream
  temporary storage. Its otherwise capability-restricted master retains only
  the `CHOWN` capability needed to hand these directories to its unprivileged
  workers during startup.
- pgAdmin joins only two internal networks: one with Nginx and one with
  PostgreSQL. The Nginx listener is the only published path, on TCP/14433 and
  bound to the explicit interface selected by `PGADMIN_LISTEN_BIND_IP`.
- Nginx terminates TLS with the existing domain certificate, requires Basic
  Auth for every pgAdmin request, applies request/connection limits, keeps
  connection establishment short, allows five minutes for upstream query
  responses, disables response caching, and preserves pgAdmin's
  application-aware CSP.
- pgAdmin accepts only `pg.<domain>` as its host header, trusts exactly one
  reverse proxy, uses secure/HTTP-only/Strict cookies, enforces internal
  authentication, locks accounts after three failed pgAdmin logins, and
  disables SSH tunnelling, database-password saving/query history, and Gravatar
  lookups.
